#### Courses:

* Advanced Probabilistic Machine Learning: 
  * Lectures:    /
  * Homework:   
  * Link: 

>I'm attending the theoretical lectures live on Zoom with Tubingen students. Currently on week 3.



* Probabilistic Machine Learning: Phillip Hennig course @Tubingen:
  * Lectures:  7/24

> * This is my favourite course.
>
> * This course doesn't provide any assignments/homeworks. 
>
> * But it's very broad +  
> * Sometimes, Prof. Hennig likes to go deep on the mathematical aspects, provide proofs or at least sketches.
> * Perfect accompany for Bishop/Murphy.



* Reinforcement Learning: Amir-MAssoud Fahramand course @UToronto
  * Lectures: /
  * Homework:    /

> * This is a great course on RL.
>
> * Prof. Fahramand does the proofs of a lot of methods which is always cool. Also, 



* Learning Theory: Shai Ben-David course at UToronto
  * Lectures: 

> Great lectures.

#### Textbooks that I'm using:

* Bishop (2006) 
* Murphy (2012)



* **Coding/Tools: **PyTorch, Python, VIM, Latex



#### Interests/ Projects:

I'm interested in 2 topics:

* ML for Medical Imaging 
* Generative Modelling for Compression

I'll start working on these projects soon to build my CV. The first in mid-November ad the second in Mid-December.



#### Misc:

I was studying some Measure theory, Functional analysis (From Claudio Landim at IMPA), but I stopped by the beginning November to focus more on Probabilistic ML. I felt like I was drifting too much into the theory and It was consuming a lot of my energy. I will get back to do more pure Maths on Mid-Dec, definitely before I start applying for Jobs. 

I also have a good background on Probability Theory, Linear Algebra ad Matrix Calculus. But I might consider devoting some time to High-Dimensional Probability.
