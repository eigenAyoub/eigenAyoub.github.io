I answer the following questions:

* Why does the spectral radius matter?
* Why do convergent matrices matter?
* How to determine the eigenvalues of a matrix?
* Practically speaking, we try to solve the following linear problem using the point Jacobi iterative method:

\\[
Ax = b, \quad \text{s.t: $$A$$ is invertible and } A_{ii}\neq 0 \quad \forall i
\\]

### A primal on convergent and bounded matrices: 

* Let $$A$$ be a squared matrix of size $$n$$, we have:

\\[
A \quad \text{is convergent}  \iff  \rho(A) < 1 \quad \text{(the spectral radius of $$A$$)}
\\]

**Proof:**

## Extra:


* Jacobi method shines: Large sparse linear systems (Gaussian elimination is impractical)
Why?


* Is it still actively used?
