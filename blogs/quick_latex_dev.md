Latex had always halted my progress/productivity in the past. As I'm 
maintaining a healthy relationship with it now, I'll try to collect some tips&tricks that could help you avoid some bottlenecks and quickly get you to the point.



## Contents:
* [Minimal settings](#minimal-settings) Minimal configs, scripts to run and compile latex. 
* [Abbreviations](#abbreviations)
* [VIM](#vim) My vimrc, snippets and configs for Latex
* [Misc](#misc) 
* [References](#references)


## Minimal settings:

A minimal document:

Command line to run:
