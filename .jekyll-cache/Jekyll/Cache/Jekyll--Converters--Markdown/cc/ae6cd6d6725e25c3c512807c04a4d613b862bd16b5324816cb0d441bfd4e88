<p>Latex had always halted my progress/productivity in the past. As I’m 
maintaining a healthy relationship with it now, I’ll try to collect some tips&amp;tricks that could help you avoid some bottlenecks and quickly get you to the point.</p>

<h2 id="minimal-settings">Minimal settings:</h2>

<p>A minimal document:</p>

<p>Command line to run:</p>

<p>Wait, I dont want those .ps, .this .that files post-compilation:</p>

<p>Wait, I want this and that : 
	Enough, You need a Makefile</p>

<h2 id="makefile">Makefile:</h2>

<h2 id="abbreviations">Abbreviations:</h2>

<p>Abbreviations are crutial in ..</p>

<p>Here you can find</p>

<p>Also, this is .sty used by Sutton &amp; Barto. In case you were into Reinforcement Learning. Hopefully you are.</p>

<p>How to add them to your makefile:</p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc:</h2>

<p>One very underated skill that I have found useful is to increase my typing speed, I went from 30 wpm (yes, I was awful), to approx. 60wpm. This was really a game-changer. I recommend using <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a>, a random words generator that calibrates each letter apart.</p>
