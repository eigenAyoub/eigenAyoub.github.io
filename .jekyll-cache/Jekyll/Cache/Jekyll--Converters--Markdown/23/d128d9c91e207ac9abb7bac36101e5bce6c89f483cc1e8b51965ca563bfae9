    <li>
      <p>This is my favourite course.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>This course doesnâ€™t provide any assignments/homeworks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>But itâ€™s very broad +</li>
    <li>Sometimes, Prof. Hennig likes to go deep on the mathematical aspects, provide proofs or at least sketches.</li>
    <li>Perfect accompany for Bishop/Murphy.</li>

    <li>
      <p>This is a great course on RL.</p>
    </li>

      <p>Prof. Fahramand does the proofs of a lot of methods which is always cool. Also,</p>

<h4 id="interests-projects">Interests/ Projects:</h4>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in 2 topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ML for Medical Imaging</li>
  <li>Generative Modelling for Compression</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ll start working on these projects soon to build my CV. The first in mid-November ad the second in Mid-December.</p>

<h4 id="misc">Misc:</h4>

<p>I was studying some Measure theory, Functional analysis (From Claudio Landim at IMPA), but I stopped by the beginning November to focus more on Probabilistic ML. I felt like I was drifting too much into the theory and It was consuming a lot of my energy. I will get back to do more pure Maths on Mid-Dec, definitely before I start applying for Jobs.</p>

<p>I also have a good background on Probability Theory, Linear Algebra ad Matrix Calculus. But I might consider devoting some time to High-Dimensional Probability.</p>
