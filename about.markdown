* I'm Ayoub. I'm 25, Moroccan. I got a Master's degree in July 2019 (software engineering major).
* **[November 2021]** I decided to switch careers and pursue ML research. 
* Right now, I'm purely devoted to learning (at home). It's tough but I'm happier now.
* I'll start writing about what I'm learning, mainly **Probabilistic ML** and **RL**.
  * At first I started writing in Markdown but then I decided to switch over to Latex since I'll be forced to use in the future.
  * I'll be writing a lot of notes/tutorial-blogs.
