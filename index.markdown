## About me:
* [Hey You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-MU_5VkjtE), I'm Ayoub. I'm a **Computational Mathematics** Master's student at the **University of PASSAU, Germany.** The Winter Semester 2023/2024 would be my third semester. I also hold a Master's degree in Software Engineering, from ENSIAS, Morocco in 2019.
* I am interested (and have a strong background) in Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Programming.
